Download 'Floor 1.html' and 'Floor 1.png' to the same map on your computer and run 'Floor 1.html' to start the Terminal

A Network chart following the rules of the Hackers Handbook has been added as a powerpoint file.

At the time of publishing only Floor 1 has been created.

The terminal was build in Twine (https://twinery.org/), runs in a browser and is easy to alter.
All passwords for the various network locations are declared in the 'Boot Sequence' and can be changed freely.

Pressing "C" while running the 'Boot Sequence' page will skip to the 'Settings' page in which a different color scheme can be chosen.

The retro terminal displays texts at a rate of 10ms per character to create a typewriter appearance
By pressing "Ctrl" this is skipped and the page is displayed at once.

To simulate a Hack by a player press "Ctrl + X" in a screen that requires a password.
The terminal will skip to the next node as if the correct password was entered.

The 'Admin' page contains most passwords. The passwords can be altered here, affecting the matching password check.
Be aware that changes here are not saved when closing the file.

For the 'Maps' page to display an image, an image named 'Floor 1.png' needs to be placed in the same map as the Terminal file is run from.
A map representing Floor 1 before the take-over by Monarch is included.
