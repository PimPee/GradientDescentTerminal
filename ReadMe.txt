Download 'Gradient Descent Terminals.html' and the .png files to the same map on your computer and run 'Gradient Descent Terminals.html' to start.
If you want to use different pictures than the ones added, replace the original .png with another one with the same name.

Currently 14 terminals that are found in The Deep are included.
More may be added in the future.

A Network chart following the rules of the Hackers Handbook has been added as a powerpoint file.

One section contains all the rooms in The Deep, using different names. The included Rooms.xlsx shows all the rooms mentioned and the module rooms they are referring to.

The terminal was build in Twine (https://twinery.org/), runs in a browser and is easy to alter.
All passwords for the various network locations are declared in the 'Boot Sequence' of each section and can be changed freely.

The retro terminal displays texts at a rate of 10ms per character to create a typewriter appearance
By pressing "Ctrl" this is skipped and the page is displayed at once.

To simulate a Hack by a player press "Ctrl + X" in a screen that requires a password.
The terminal will skip to the next node as if the correct password was entered.

The 'Admin' page in the Floor 1 section contains the passwords for Floor 1. The passwords can be altered in the terminal, affecting the matching password check.
Be aware that changes here are not saved when closing the file.
